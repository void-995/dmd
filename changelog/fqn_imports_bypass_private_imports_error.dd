The deprecation phase for fully qualified names that bypassed private imports is finished

---
// a.d
import std.stdio;
---

---
// b.d
import a;

void main()
{
    std.stdio.writefln("foo");         // deprecation before patch, now errors
}
---

In order to compile the example successfully, `public` needs to be added
to the import located in `a.d` : `public import std.stdio;` or `import std.stdio;`
needs to be added to `b.d`.
