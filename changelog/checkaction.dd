Add `-checkaction=D|C|halt` compiler switch.

It covers action taken when an assert fails, a bounds check fails,
or a final switch error happens. D means the usual D behavior of
throwing an `Error`, C means call the C runtime library assert failure
function, and halt means halt the program execution.

The halt is the main addition here, it enables very lightweight assert's.
